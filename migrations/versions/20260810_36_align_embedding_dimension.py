"""align the pgvector column width with the configured embedding dimension

The `article_chunks.embedding` column was created at 1024 dimensions, back when the
default EMBEDDING_MODEL was BGE-M3. The deployed model is gemini-embedding-001 asked for
768 dimensions, so indexing failed on every chunk with:

    asyncpg.exceptions.DataError: expected 1024 dimensions, not 768

pgvector fixes the width in the column type, so the model definition
(`Vector(settings.EMBEDDING_DIMENSION)`) has no effect on a table that already exists —
only a migration can change it.

Existing vectors CANNOT be converted: a 1024-dimension vector is not a truncation of the
768-dimension one, it is a point in a different space. So this migration refuses to run
if any embeddings are present rather than silently discarding them or, worse, leaving a
corpus where some vectors are comparable and others are not. Re-embedding is the only
correct path, and it is the operator's decision to schedule.
