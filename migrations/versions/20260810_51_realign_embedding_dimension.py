"""re-align the pgvector column width after moving back to a local embedding model

20260810_36 narrowed `article_chunks.embedding` to whatever EMBEDDING_DIMENSION resolved
to at the time — 768, for the hosted gemini-embedding-001. EMBEDDING_MODEL is now
BAAI/bge-m3 again, which emits 1024, and indexing fails on every chunk with:

    asyncpg.exceptions.DataError: expected 768 dimensions, not 1024

A second migration rather than an edit to 20260810_36, because that one has already been
applied where this is deployed; Alembic will not re-run it. Both read
settings.EMBEDDING_DIMENSION and no-op when the column already matches, so on a database
migrated after the model change this one finds the width correct and does nothing.

Existing vectors CANNOT be converted: a 768-dimension vector is not a truncation of the
1024-dimension one, it is a point in a different space. So this refuses to run if any
embeddings are present rather than silently discarding them or, worse, leaving a corpus
where some vectors are comparable and others are not. Re-embedding is the only correct
path, and it is the operator's decision to schedule:

    DELETE FROM article_chunks;
    -- then re-run this migration and let the API's startup sweep re-index
