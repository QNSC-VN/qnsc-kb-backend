"""Ensure the least-privilege application database role exists.

Migration ``20260802_05_tenant_rls`` grants schema, table and sequence privileges to
``APP_DATABASE_ROLE`` but never creates it. Under Compose that gap is filled by
``docker/init-db.sh``, which Postgres runs as a container init hook. A managed
database (RDS) has no such hook, so the role has to be created by something that runs
before the migrations — this script, from the migrator task's entrypoint.

Connects with ``MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`` (the master credential), falling back to
``DATABASE_URL`` exactly as ``migrations/env.py`` does. Creating a role requires
CREATEROLE, which the application role deliberately does not hold.

No-ops when either ``APP_DATABASE_ROLE`` or ``APP_DATABASE_PASSWORD`` is unset, so a
deployment that has not adopted the least-privilege role still migrates normally.

The password is re-applied on every run, not only at creation. Rotating the secret
therefore takes effect on the next deploy without a manual ``ALTER ROLE`` — otherwise
the application would keep the new password while the role kept the old one, and the
failure would surface as an authentication error minutes later in a different task.
