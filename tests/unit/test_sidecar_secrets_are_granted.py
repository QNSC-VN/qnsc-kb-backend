"""A service running a sidecar must be allowed to read that sidecar's secrets.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR happened in rally, not here, and this repo was right only
because someone remembered to be. rally wired the cloudflared sidecar into its api task
and did not add the tunnel token to the execution role's read list. Terraform applied
cleanly. Nothing failed until the next task START:

    ResourceInitializationError: unable to pull secrets or registry auth:
    AccessDeniedException: User: .../rally-develop-api-exec is not authorized to
    perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource:
    .../secret:rally/develop/tunnel-token-tf-*

ECS could not fetch the token, the task never started, the deployment circuit breaker
rolled the service back — and because rollback leaves the PREVIOUS task definition
serving, the service stayed healthy. develop ran a ten-day-old image for two days while
reporting ready, and the only signal was red deploy runs nobody was reading.

WHY A TEST AND NOT A BETTER ABSTRACTION. `tunnel-agent` already publishes a `secret_arns`
output whose description says "Concat into ecs-service's secret_arns, or the task fails to
start" — the contract was written down and simply not consumed. The obvious fix, reading
that output here instead of naming the secret, was tried and REVERTED: the module gates it
on `enabled = var.tunnel_token_secret_arn != ""`, so in an environment where the secret
does not exist yet the ARN is an unknown attribute, the list's length is unknown, and
`ecs-service`'s `count = length(var.secret_arns) + ... > 0` cannot be computed at plan
time. The splat form is the correct one, and nothing in Terraform can require it.

So the invariant is asserted here instead, and deliberately asserts the PERMISSION IS
PRESENT rather than where it comes from — a test demanding the module output would push
the next person into the form that breaks planning.

SCOPE. Exactly one sidecar in this stack needs a secret. `beat` and `clamav` need none, so
they are not listed. A second sidecar that reads a secret needs a line in
SIDECARS_NEEDING_SECRETS below; that edit is the point, not an oversight.
