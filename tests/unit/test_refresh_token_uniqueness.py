"""Two refresh tokens minted for the same user must never be identical.

refresh_sessions.token_hash carries a UNIQUE index, and rotation revokes the old row and
inserts a new one in the same request. The claims used to be {exp, sub, type, av}, and
`exp` has one-second resolution — so two tokens minted for one user inside the same
second were byte-identical, the insert raised UniqueViolationError, and /auth/refresh
returned 500.

It is not a narrow race: signing in and refreshing immediately hits it, as does a second
browser tab refreshing at the same moment. Revoked rows keep their hash, so a collision
outlives the session it replaced.
