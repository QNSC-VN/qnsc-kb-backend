# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
#
# One image definition, three targets: api, worker, migrator.
#
# It lives at the repo root and takes a target because the shared deploy pipeline
# (QNSC-VN/qnsc-ci .github/workflows/backend-deploy.yml) builds each service by passing
# `build-target` against ONE Dockerfile and has no per-service dockerfile input.
#
# TWO RULES SHAPE THIS FILE, both learned the expensive way:
#
#   1. Application code is copied LAST, per target. Docker invalidates every layer above
#      a changed one, so anything large must sit below the thing that changes on every
#      commit. `COPY . .` used to sit under the model bake, so each commit stored a fresh
#      2.3 GB layer — 81.6 GB of ECR across 21 builds.
#
#   2. Only the worker gets the OCR stack. paddle is ~1 GB and only the worker extracts
#      text from scanned files. The api image carried it, plus torch and 2.3 GB of
#      embedding weights, in order to embed a search query — 3.5 GB compressed, and a
#      2 GB memory floor before it could answer anything.
#
# Build locally:
#   docker build --target api      -t qnsc-kb-api .
#   docker build --target worker   -t qnsc-kb-worker .
#   docker build --target migrator -t qnsc-kb-migrator .

# stay here and never reach a shipped image.
